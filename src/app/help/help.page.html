  </ion-row>
  <ion-row>
    <p>
      The Constitution App is developed by the Democratic Governance and Rights Unit of the Faculty of Law, University
      of Cape Town in collaboration with AfricanLII and Laws.Africa, with funding support from the Konrad Adenauer
      Stiftung. The aim of the project is to equip South African parliamentarians with accurate and authoritative
      information on South African constitutional law.
    </p>
    <p>In this application, you will find an updated version of the South African constitution, together with
      commentary of its key provisions and their interpretation by South Africaâ€™s highest courts. The app allows you
      to browse through and read summaries as well as the full text of constitutional court judgments. The content of
      this application is available off-line and will be updated twice a year.</p>

The State is obliged to publish legislation and take other administrative steps to ensure it fulfils this duty and if the State fails an individual can evoke section 24 of the Constitution. It is imperative to note that this constitutional obligation not only applies to the State but action by companies and individuals can also be measured against this constitutional obligation.

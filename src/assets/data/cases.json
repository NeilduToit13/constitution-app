    "dateOfJudgment": 1178755200,
    "courtName": "Constitutional Court",
    "topics": "Bill of Rights",
    "justicesConcurring": "Langa CJ (Moseneke DCJ, Madala J, Mokgoro J, Navsa AJ, Ngcobo J, Nkabinde J, Sachs J, Skweyiya J and Van der Westhuizen J)",
    "summary": "A School Code of Conduct banned the wearing of jewellery (at school), except for plain stud earrings and wrist watches. The ban extended to any other piercings, including nose studs. A learner, taking part in a voluntary (non-compulsory) cultural and religious practice, pierced her nose and returned to school after the holidays wearing a nose stud, in contravention of the School Code of Conduct. Does the refusal of the school \u2013 in enforcing uniformity under the terms of its Code of Conduct, to which the learner consented through her parent upon admission to the school \u2013 amount to unfair discrimination and/or a violation of the learner\u2019s cultural and religious rights under sections 9 and 31 of the Constitution respectively? The Constitutional Court found that the refusal amounted to a violation of those rights; and that schools must reasonably accommodate differences and diversity in their communities. The Court found that it was legitimate (in general) for schools to promote uniformity in aiming to establish a disciplined school environment, but that exceptions (reasonable accommodations) must be allowed where demanded by the Constitution \u2013 as determined through a balancing of rights and interests. The Court ordered the School to amend its Code of Conduct to provide for exemption procedures allowing learners, on genuine cultural or religious grounds, to apply for permission to deviate from the uniform and other standards and requirements of the Code of Conduct, thereby allowing for the rights and interests to be weighed and balanced in the specific circumstances on a case-by-case basis.",
    "snippet": "NaN",
    "facts": "Ms Sunali Pillay (the learner), through her mother Ms V Pillay (the Respondent), had consented to the school Code of Conduct upon admission to the school in 2002. The Code of Conduct banned the wearing of jewellery (at school), including any piercings, and except for plain stud earrings and wrist watches. A learner, taking part in a voluntary (non-compulsory) cultural and religious practice, pierced her nose and returned to school after the holidays wearing a nose stud, in contravention of the School Code of Conduct. After consultation between the parties, and between the School and experts, the School ultimately refused to allow her to continue wearing the nose stud and sought to enforce its Code of Conduct against her through conducting a disciplinary hearing. The refusal and scheduling of a disciplinary hearing prompted Ms V Pillay (the Respondent) to launch proceedings in the Equality Court.",
    "decision": "The Court noted that whilst uniforms and school rules serve an important purpose in education, the case was not about uniforms in general, but about a specific exemption to a uniform. The Court found that permitting this particular exemption would not endanger uniformity or school discipline in general; but rather that granting an exemption to Ms Sunali Pillay (the learner) might encourage more learners to express their religion or culture, which was to be celebrated, not feared (as diversity itself is to be promoted and celebrated not only tolerated). The Court ruled that the constitutional rights and protections (namely, under section 31) apply equally to both compulsory and voluntary (non-compulsory) practices of culture and religion.",
    "dissent": "O\u2019Regan J partially dissented. O\u2019Regan J agreed with most of the order and reasons of the majority, but disagreed with the part of the order in which the Court declared the refusal by the School to allow Ms Sunali Pillay to wear the nose stud as unfair discrimination (the declaratory relief).\n\nMs Sunali Pillay had graduated and left the school before judgment was handed down by the Constitutional Court. O\u2019Regan J argued that because of this, the declaratory relief was moot (\u2018pointless\u2019) and inappropriate. O\u2019Regan contended that had Ms Sunali Pillay still be enrolled at the School by the time the Court heard the case, it would have been appropriate to refer the matter back to the School for the proper exemption procedure to be carried out in accordance with its amended Code of Conduct.",

    "topics": "Bill of Rights",
    "justicesConcurring": "Cameron J (Mogoeng CJ, Froneman J, Jafta J, Khampepe J, MadlangaJ, Mathopo AJ, Mhlantla J, Theron J and Victor AJ)",
    "summary": "Following an extensive and exhaustive process, and in the wake of Fees Must Fall and Open Stellenbosch upheavals on its campus in 2015, the University of Stellenbosch adopted a new language policy in 2016 under the Higher Education Act and the National Language Policy for Higher Education (LPHE) to replace its 2014 policy which would have cost the University millions more Rands in infrastructure and annual operational costs, resulting in fee increases. The 2016 Policy makes teaching primarily English: teaching is in both English and Afrikaans; and where demand is insufficient and recourses do not permit, only Afrikaans translations are provided, coupled with questions and answers in Afrikaans. \n\nThe Court upheld the 2016 Policy which was challenged under both section 29(2) and section 6 of the Constitution, ruling that it validly replaced the 2014 Policy which was not reasonably practicable as determined by the University.",
    "snippet": "Gelyke Kanse v ... was about the language policy at Stellenbosch. The Court focused on the interpretation of the need for minority's rights to language and its inclusion in the education policy.",
    "facts": "The Senate and Council of the University of Stellenbosch adopted a new language policy in 2016. The University\u2019s previous policy, adopted in 2014, established English and Afrikaans as languages of instruction (with interpretation). Compared to the 2016 Policy, the 2014 Policy would have cost an additional R640 million in infrastructure, plus about R78 million per year thereafter, entailing a 20% increase in fees (R8100 on top of the approximately R40 000 per year per student). The 2016 Policy makes teaching primarily English: teaching is in both English and Afrikaans \u2018where reasonably practicable and pedagogically sound\u2019 (parallel medium); and where demand is insufficient and recourses do not permit, only Afrikaans translations are provided, coupled with questions and answers in Afrikaans (as opposed to real-time interpreting). At the time of the judgment, Afrikaans was still offered on large scale at undergraduate level; all first-year lectures continue to be offered in Afrikaans; any student could be taught in English.",
    "decision": "The Court ruled, in respect of the section 6 challenge, that Afrikaans did not suffer \u2018historically diminished use and status\u2019 and therefore not qualify as a disadvantaged indigenous language in terms of section 6(2), even though it did qualify as indigenous; it only qualifies and is protected as an official language under section 6(4). \n\nThe state has a much wider margin under section 6(4) than under section 6(2). Under section 6(2), the state is obliged to advance historically diminished languages through \u2018practical and positive measures\u2019 without disregarding the official languages under section 6(4). However, under section 6(4), the state is only required to treat the official languages listed equitably by not diminishing them. This means that the state cannot disregard the official languages and is obliged to conserve them, but not at the expense of corrective, advancement measures under section 6(2).\n\nUltimately, the Court acknowledged that whilst the world was growing more hostile to minority languages, it was not the University\u2019s burden to prevent the decline of Afrikaans across South African tertiary institutions.[topic:T02];\nThe Court[topic:T03]",
    "dissent": "Moegoeng CJ concurred separately, emphasizing emphasized the need to develop all indigenous languages including the spoken languages of the First Nation people. \n\nFroneman J concurred separately, laying out the implications of English dominance as a medium of instruction, namely the diminished use and protection of minority indigenous languages.",

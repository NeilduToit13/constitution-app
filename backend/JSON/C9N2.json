As a result, the personal costs order made against her was justified. \r\n\r\nThe minority judgement written by Mogoeng CJ (Goliath AJ concurring) decided that the courts exist not as places to crush litigants but to teach them and caution constructively. The minority judgement further held that making the applicant personally responsible for the costs of the case would ruin her financially and career-wise.\r", "citedCases": ["Economic Freedom Fighters v Speaker, National Assembly [2016] ZACC 11; 2016 (3) SA 580 (CC); 2016 (5) BCLR 618 (CC)", "Plastic Converters Association of South Africa on behalf of Members v National Union of Metalworkers of SA [2016] ZALAC 39\u037e [2016] 37 ILJ 2815 (LAC) (Plastic Converters Association of South Africa)", "Absa Bank Limited v Public Protector 2018 JDR 0190 (GP) (High Court judgment)", "Black Sash Trust v Minister of Social Development [2017] ZACC 20; 2017 (9) BCLR 1089 (CC)", "United Democratic Movement v Speaker, National Assembly [2017] ZACC 21; 2017 (5) SA 300 (CC); 2017 (8) BCLR 1061 (CC)", "Mazibuko N.O. v Sisulu N.O.

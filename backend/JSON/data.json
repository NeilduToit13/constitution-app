The University\u2019s previous policy, adopted in 2014, established English and Afrikaans as languages of instruction (with interpretation). Compared to the 2016 Policy, the 2014 Policy would have cost an additional R640 million in infrastructure, plus about R78 million per year thereafter, entailing a 20% increase in fees (R8100 on top of the approximately R40 000 per year per student). The 2016 Policy makes teaching primarily English: teaching is in both English and Afrikaans \u2018where reasonably practicable and pedagogically sound\u2019 (parallel medium); and where demand is insufficient and recourses do not permit, only Afrikaans translations are provided, coupled with questions and answers in Afrikaans (as opposed to real-time interpreting). At the time of the judgment, Afrikaans was still offered on large scale at undergraduate level; all first-year lectures continue to be offered in Afrikaans; any student could be taught in English.\n\nFollowing an extensive and exhaustive process, and in the wake of Fees Must Fall and Open Stellenbosch upheavals on its campus in 2015, the University of Stellenbosch adopted a new language policy in 2016 under the Higher Education Act and the National Language Policy for Higher Education (LPHE) to replace its 2014 policy which would have cost the University millions more Rands in infrastructure and annual operational costs, resulting in fee increases. The 2016 Policy makes teaching primarily English: teaching is in both English and Afrikaans; and where demand is insufficient and recourses do not permit, only Afrikaans translations are provided, coupled with questions and answers in Afrikaans. \n\nThe Court upheld the 2016 Policy which was challenged under both section 29(2) and section 6 of the Constitution, ruling that it validly replaced the 2014 Policy which was not reasonably practicable as determined by the University.", "snippet": "This case concerned the decisions of the Senate and Council of the University of Stellenbosch to adopt a new language policy for the University (2016 Policy).

Under section 6(2), the state is obliged to advance historically diminished languages through \u2018practical and positive measures\u2019 without disregarding the official languages under section 6(4). However, under section 6(4), the state is only required to treat the official languages listed equitably by not diminishing them. This means that the state cannot disregard the official languages and is obliged to conserve them, but not at the expense of corrective, advancement measures under section 6(2).\n\nUltimately, the Court acknowledged that whilst the world was growing more hostile to minority languages, it was not the University\u2019s burden to prevent the decline of Afrikaans across South African tertiary institutions.", "dissent": "Moegoeng CJ concurred separately, emphasizing emphasized the need to develop all indigenous languages including the spoken languages of the First Nation people. \n\nFroneman J concurred separately, laying out the implications of English dominance as a medium of instruction, namely the diminished use and protection of minority indigenous languages.", "citedCases": ["Kanse v The President of the Convocation of the Stellenbosch University 2017 JDR 1687 (WCC)", "Plascon-Evans Paints Ltd v Van Riebeeck Paints (Pty) Ltd 1984 (3) SA 623 (A)", "Ex parte Gauteng Provincial Legislature: In re Dispute Concerning the Constitutionality of Certain Provisions of the Gauteng School Education Bill of 1995 1996 (3) SA 165 (CC)", "University of Free State v AfriForum 2017 (4) SA 283 (SCA)", "Head of Department Mpumalanga Department of Education and Another v Hoerskool Ermelo and Another 2010 (2) SA 415 (CC)", "AfriForum v University of the Free State 2018 (2) SA 185 (CC)", "AfriForum v Chairperson of the Council of the University of Pretoria 2017 JDR 0150 (GP)", "Bato Star Fishing (Pty) Ltd v Minister of Environmental Affairs and Tourism 2004 (4) SA 490 (CC)", "Minister of Environmental Affairs and Tourism v Phambili Fisheries (Pty) Ltd; Minister of Environmental Affairs and Tourism v Bato Star Fishing (Pty) Ltd 2003 (6) SA 407 (SCA)", "Logbro Properties CC v Bedderson N.O. 2003 (2) SA 460 (SCA)", "City of Johannesburg Metropolitan Municipality v Blue Moonlight Properties 39 (Pty) Ltd 2012 (2) SA 104 (CC)", "Turnbull-Jackson v Hibiscus Coast Municipality 2014 (6) SA 592 (CC)", "Tshwane City v AfriForum 2016 (6) SA 279 (CC)", "Daniels v Scribante 2017 (4) SA 341 (CC)"]}, {"id": "S29N2", "href": "http://www.saflii.org/za/cases/ZACC/2017/48.html", "title": "AfriForum and Another v University of the Free State", "featured": false, "highlighted": false, "dateOfJudgment": "2017-12-27T00:00:00+00:00", "courtName": "Constitutional Court", "topics": ["sec_29__Education"], "justicesConcurring": "Mogoeng CJ (Nkabinde ADCJ, Jafta J, Khampepe J, Madlanga J, Mhlantla J, Mojapelo AJ and Zondo J) Froneman J (Cameron J, Pretorius AJ)", "summary": "The University of the Free State formalised a bilingual (Afrikaans and English) language policy in 2003 after phasing it in since 1993.

The Court found that it was legitimate (in general) for schools to promote uniformity in aiming to establish a disciplined school environment, but that exceptions (reasonable accommodations) must be allowed where demanded by the Constitution \u2013 as determined through a balancing of rights and interests.

The second applicant, a natural person described herself as a representative of Khoi and San communities and a princess of the Korona Royal Household of the Khoi and the San First Nation. It appears that the objectives of the applicants to an extent were similiar and they were essentially averse to joining or forming a political party and believed that the current electoral system infinged on their constitutional rights.The applicants  applied to the Western Cape High Court on an urgent basis to declare the Electoral Act 73 of 1998 unconstitutional to the extent that an individual could not contest tha national and provincial elections. The matter was heard on an urgent basis as the national elections were to be held in a few weeks. \n\nThe Western Cape High Court dismissed the matter on 17 April 2019 and the aApplicants then urgently applied for direct leave to appeal the Western Cape High Court judgment to the Constitutional Court on 19 April 2019. In light of the pending elections, the  Constitutional Court only heard arguments on the question of the urgency of the matter on 2 May 2019.  The Constitutional Court held that the Applicants did not make out a case for urgency and postponed the matter to be argued on 15 August 2019\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe New Nation Movement judgment declared the Electoral Act of 1998 unconstitutional, to the extent that individuals can only be elected to the National Assembly and Provincial Legislature through membership of their political parties. It is, however, important to note that the Constitutional Court did not consider what electoral system would be more appropriate, as this falls within the mandate of Parliament, and hence the Order was suspended for two years in order for Parliament to remedy the defect.  \n \nThe constitutional challenge in the judgment was essentially distilled to two critical aspects. Firstly, the meaning of s 19(3)(b) of the Constitution, which states that \u201cEvery adult citizen has the right (b) to stand for public office and if, elected, to hold office\u201d had to be determined. Secondly, the Court had to determine whether s 57A of the Electoral Act, read with schedule 1A of the Act (which, in effect, required a citizen to be a member of a political party to contest national and provincial elections) unjustifiably limited an individual\u2019s right to freedom of association, provided for in s 18 of the Constitution. The question was approached holistically by Madlanga J who held that that s 19(3)(b) of the Constitution must be read not only in conjunction with the right to freedom of association but also with other political rights in s 19 of the Constitution.  Madlanga J held that the choice to form a political party in terms of s 19(1) equally includes the right not to join a political party. If s 19(3)(b) is read that only by joining a political party an individual can exercise the right to stand for public office, then it is in conflict with s 19(1), which equally protects the choice not to join a political party. \n\nOn the second aspect concerning the right to freedom of association, Madlanga J held that on consideration of foreign and international law, the right equally includes the right not to be forced to join an association. The question then turned to whether the limitation of the right to freedom of association by the Electoral Act could be justified as a reasonable limitation in terms of s 36 of the Constitution. The majority however found that the respondents were unable to justify on evidence  the limitation and  therefore the Electoral Act was held to be unconstitutional, to the extent that it excluded independent candidates to contest national and provincial elections.", "snippet": "", "facts": "", "decision": "Section 1 \u2013 the founding  values of the Constitution:\r\n\r\nIn the Constitution, s 1 refers to the founding values of the Constitution. These values emphasise that the Republic of South Africa is \u201cone, sovereign, democratic state\u201d which is founded on various core value such as human dignity, non-racialism, supremacy of the Constitution and a multi-party system of democratic governance. It is  important to note that these  founding values form the premise of our constitutional order and in terms of the Constitution a high threshold is required to amend these provisions\r\n\r\nIn this judgment s 1 (d) of the Constitution was specifically considered as the Western Cape High Court held that the founding values of s 1(d) do not support the applicant\u2019s case. Section 1(d) of the Constitution provides that the founding values of the Republic include: \u201dUniversal adult suffrage, a national common voters roll, regular elections and a multi-party system of democratic government, to ensure accountability, responsiveness and openness\u201d. The applicants argued that s 1(d) of the Constitution cannot be read as requiring an exclusively party based proportional representation system. \r\nThe majority of the Constitutional Court on considering this aspect, held that s 1(d) of the Constitution says nothing about the exclusivity of multi-party representation. A multi-party democracy allows different political groups to organise and participate in an election but this does not mean only political groups can do so.

The respondent was found guilty of murder and was sentenced to death. In 1997 he however applied for amnesty under the Promotion of National Unity and Reconciliation Act 34 of 1995 and was granted it in 2001. In 2003 the respondent was a candidate to head the Ekurhuleni metro police. The appellant in September and October 2003 published various articles and editorials questioning the respondent\u2019s candidacy and expressed the view that he was a \u201ccriminal\u201d and \u201cmurdered\u201d. Some of the articles failed to mention that the respondent was granted amnesty by the National Truth and Reconciliation Commission and the respondent sued the appellant and other journalists for defamation in the Witwatersrand Local Division (South Gauteng High Court), arguing that the articles were malicious as he was granted amnesty. The respondent was successful in the High Court with the defamation claim and the appellants then appealed to the Supreme Court of Appeal. The Supreme Court of Appeal only partially upheld the appeal and reduced the amount of damages awarded to the respondent. The appellants then appealed to the constitutional Court against the Supreme Court of Appeal judgment and the respondent cross-appealed the reduction in damages awarded by the Supreme Court of Appeal.\n\nThe key issue the Constitutional Court had to determine was how amnesty granted to the respondent for crimes committed (during the struggle against apartheid) by the National Truth and Reconciliation Commission affected a claim for defamation. The respondent was granted amnesty in terms of the Promotion of National Unity and Reconciliation Act 34 of 1995 for crimes committed in 1986. In 2003 the appellants in various commentary covering the candidacy of the respondent for the position of head of the Erkhuleni Metro police referred to the respondent as a \u201cmurderer\u201d and \u201ccriminal\u201d. Justice Cameron writing for the majority geld that the Promotion of National Unity and Reconciliation Act 34 of 1995 did not make the fact that the respondent committed murder untrue and the Act did not prohibit frank public discussion. Justice Cameron emphasised that the requirement that a comment must be \u201dfair\u201d  protects criticism even if it is extreme so long it is without malice, on a matter of public interest and  on facts that are true. The Constitutional Court therefore upheld the appellant\u2019s main appeal and dismissed the respondent\u2019s cross appeal but the Court did find that the appellant had defamed the respondent by claiming falsely that he was not contrite and awarded the respondent damages on this aspect.", "snippet": "", "facts": "", "decision": "As the matter essentially concerned a defamation claim and the defences raised thereto a key issue the Constitutional Court had to decide was, how to find a balance between two constitutional rights, namely the appellant\u2019s right to freedom of expression on the one hand and the respondent\u2019s right to human dignity. Justice Cameron writing for the majority, emphasised that the right to human dignity is not only given separate constitutional recognition in s 10 of the Constitution but is also one of the founding values of the society terms of s 1. Therefore, a failure to uphold the right is not only a violation of s10 but is also a threat to a founding value underpinning the legitimacy of the State. However importantly Cameron J, pointed out that freedom of expression is just as important as human dignity and one cannot say that human dignity trumps freedom of expression. The law of defamation importantly must be interpreted to give effect to the appropriate balance between the right to freedom of expression on the one hand and a person\u2019s human dignity on the other hand. Cameron J held on this interpretation that the requirement that a comment must be \u201cfair\u201d in defence to a claim for defamation gives effect to the balance between the right to freedom of expression and dignity.", "dissent": "Partial dissenting judgments were written by Ngcobo J and Mogoeng J. Justice Ngcobo agreed with the majority judgment that the Promotion of National Unity and Reconciliation Act 34 of 1995 did not make the facts of the commission of the murders untrue but Ngcobo J held that the balancing of the right to freedom and the right to dignity  required the facts upon which the appellant relied in their comment to include the fact that the respondent was granted amnesty by the National Truth and Reconciliation Commission. However, on reading the coverage of the respondent\u2019s candidacy collectively Ngcobo J found that this fact was adequately stated. Justice Ngcobo however held that since the appellant failed to make reference to the circumstances under which the appellant was released from detention in Mozambique the statement of the appellant concerning gun-running allegations in Mozambique was based on \u201chalf-truths\u201d and therefore was untrue, justifying the respondent\u2019s cross appeal. Justice Mogoeng in his judgment specifically held that the defamatory statements that the respondent was a \u201ccriminal\u201d and \u201cmurder \u201cmust be determined within the context of the objective of the amnesty process and that the truth told during the amnesty process was not meant to be used in a manner that defeats the purpose of national reconciliation. Justice Mogoeng held that the defamatory statements that the respondent was a \u201cmurderer\u201d and \u201ccriminal\u201d was malicious and was contrary to the pursuit of national reconciliation.

It is important to note that the trial was concluded before the Interim Constitution (also known as the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa,1993)  came into operation and therefore the constitutionality of the death sentence was not considered  at the trial itself.\n\nChaskalson J,writing for the majority  essentially found that such an extreme form of punishment putting an end to the right to life itself and infringing on  various other constitutional rights, especially the right not to be subjected to cruel, inhuman or degrading punishment, could not be justified as  reasonable in terms of the limitation test in s33 of the Interim Constitution. The Constitutional Court declared  the death penalty unconstitutional.\n\r\nThe Constitutional Court was principally concerned with the question whether the death penalty in terms of s 277(1)(a) of the Criminal Procedure Act 51 of 1977 was in conflict with various provisions of the then Interim Constitution such as the right to life, dignity and the prohibition against \u201ccruel, inhuman or degrading punishment\u201d. \r\n\r\nChaskalson P, considered various foreign judgment  and decisions of International Human Rigs  Tribunals  that  emphasised that \u201dcruel, inhuman and degrading punishment\u201d is in clear contrast to the right of dignity which is also a  founding value of the South African Constitution.\r\n\r\nChaskalson P, applied the limitation of rights test in terms of s 33 of the Interim Constitution,which involves a two-stage test to determine  whether the limitation on a constitutional right is reasonable, necessary and proportional taking into account all competing rights.

The majority judgment written by Chaskalson P, in fact focused more on the justification of the death sentence in relation to the right not to be subject on \u201ccruel, inhuman and degrading punishment\u201d in light of alternative severe sentences such as life imprisonment. It is however  important to note that Chaskalson P held that although the right to life is stated in unqualified terms, the right itself must accommodate the right to kill in lawful self-defence of one\u2019s own life or the lives of others. \r\n\r\nThe concurring judgment of O\u2019Reagen dealt more with the right to life and O\u2019 Reagen J  explicitly held that the death sentence was also a breach of the right to life and dignity. O\u2019Reagen J,  held that the meaning of the right to life must be considered in light of its purpose for which it was included in the Constitution.

They indicated that they were willing to leave the property if given reasonable notice and provided suitable alternative land to which they could move. \r\nThey were told they could move to a place referred to as Walmer Township and they rejected the proposal saying the area was crime-ridden and over-crowded and further that they feared they would have no security of occupation there and find themselves liable to further eviction. The municipality argued that if alternative land was made available to them, they would be disrupting the housing programme and forcing the municipality to grant them preferential treatment.\r\n\n\nThe applicant sought for leave to appeal against the decision of the Supreme Court of Appeal to have the eviction order against the respondent restored. The court had to determine whether the decision of the SCA to set aside the eviction order should be overturned. It held that when dealing with constitutionally protected rights, it is important to uphold the values of human dignity, equality and freedom. One of the provisions of the Bill of Rights that has to be interpreted with these values in mind, is section 25, which provides for the right to property. This matter accordingly turns on establishing an appropriate constitutional relationship between section 25 and section 26. The court held that the provisions of section 25 (4) and (5) must be borne in mind whenever section 25 was being construed, this is because they emphasised that under the Constitution, the protection of property as an individual right was not absolute but subject to societal considerations.\n\nThe Prevention of Illegal Eviction from and Unlawful Occupation of Land Act cannot simply be looked at as a legislative mechanism to re-establish common law property rights and it should not be seen as a means of promoting legal compassion in favour of the poor.  \nIn making its decision, the court must consider all relevant circumstances, including the manner in which occupation was effected, its duration and the availability of suitable alternative accommodation or land and as such it held that the application for leave to appeal was denied.\n", "snippet": "", "facts": "", "decision": "The Court, in a unanimous decision held that considering the period which the occupiers have lived on the land, the fact that eviction is not necessary for the land to be put to productive use and that this is a relatively small group of people who appear to be genuinely homeless and in need, it would not be just and equitable to order the eviction.

She was informed that consumption charges were incurred by previous occupiers were in excess and had to be paid before the certificate could be issued.\n\nThe applicants had applied for direct access to the Constitutional Court for confirmation of an order of the High Court declaring section 118(1) of the Local Government: Municipal Systems Act unconstitutional due to its deprivation of property which was in conflict with section 25(1) of the Constitution. The High court said that the section placed limits on the owner\u2019s power to transfer immovable property. The issue before the court was whether the provisions 118(1) was consistent with section 25 of the Constitution.\r\n\nSection 118(1) of the Act and section 50(1)(a) of the Gauteng Local Government Ordinance No 17 of 1939 both precluded the transfer of immovable property unless all electricity and water consumption charges due to a municipality in connection with the property by all occupiers of including non-owner occupiers for a specified period were paid. The court in majority decided that the legislation deprives people of property. However, the deprivation is not arbitrary. The provision has an important purpose that encourages payment as well as a sense of civic responsibility. There is sufficient reason for the deprivation. Also, all municipalities had to provide owners with copies of electricity and water accounts sent to occupiers if the owners requested these in writing.

This confirmation in itself is critical as South Africa was prior to 1994 divided into various homelands (Bantustans) of which Black South Africans were made citizens of. Section one furthermore confirms that the Republic of South Africa is founded on various founding values such as human dignity, non-racialism, supremacy of the Constitution and a multi-party system of democratic governance. \r\nIt is critical to note that an amendment to section one of the Constitution requires a high threshold. At least 75 per cent of the members of the National Assembly have to support the proposed amendment with a supporting vote of at least six  provinces in the National Council of Provinces.

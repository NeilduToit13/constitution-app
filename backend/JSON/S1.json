{"id": "S1", "contentType": "Topic", "title": "Section 1: Republic of South Africa", "content": "Section one of the Constitution provides the founding values on which the Republic of South Africa is founded on. It essentially re-affirms a new state order and confirms a  clear break-away from the apartheid State system characterised by unrestrained State power. It firstly confirms that the Republic of South Africa is \u201cone, sovereign, democratic state\u201d. This confirmation in itself is critical as South Africa was prior to 1994 divided into various homelands (Bantustans) of which Black South Africans were made citizens of. Section one furthermore confirms that the Republic of South Africa is founded on various founding values such as human dignity, non-racialism, supremacy of the Constitution and a multi-party system of democratic governance. \r\nIt is critical to note that an amendment to section one of the Constitution requires a high threshold. At least 75 per cent of the members of the National Assembly have to support the proposed amendment with a supporting vote of at least six  provinces in the National Council of Provinces. It is therefore always important to question whether any proposed amendment to the Constitution indirectly affects the founding values in section one of the Constitution. \r", "featured": false, "sections": ["1"], "references": ["Certification of the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa, 1996 [1996] ZACC 26; 1996 (4) SA 744 (CC); 1996 (10) BCLR 1253 (CC)", "New Nation Movement NPC and Others v President of the Republic of South Africa and Others [2020] ZACC 11"], "isBillOfRightsSection": true}

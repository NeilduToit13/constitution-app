The applicants had signed contracts for the two children with the respondent. In these contracts was a clause that allowed the respondent to cancel the contract at any time, for any reason as long as a full term\u2019s written notice was given. \n\nAfter a series of incidents where the applicants behaved inappropriately in front of young children, the respondent terminated the applicants\u2019 contracts with a written full-term notice. The applicants then proceeded to approach the High Court for an interim order whilst they sought to have the termination of their contract with the respondent cancelled.\n\nThe issue was whether the clause in the contract was a Constitutionally valid one as it did not afford the other party to the contract to state their case before the contract was terminated. \nSecondly, whether independent schools had constitutional duties and obligations that limited their exercise of contractual rights.\n\nThe court found that s 8 of the Constitution allowed for the development of the common law to hold independent schools as providing basic education. \n", "snippet": NaN, "facts": NaN, "decision": "\r\nThat the clause was unconstitutional, went against public policy and was unenforceable because there was no fair procedure followed in the case. \r\nIt was found that once an independent school provided basic education then it was required of that school to ensure that the education of the children attending the school were not affected. \r\nThe argument that only the state provides basic education and not independent schools was based on incorrect pre-constitutional common law principles that cannot stand in light of the Constitution. \r\nThe common law was developed under s 8(3)(a) to hold independent schools of providing basic education. \r", "dissent": "\r\nThere were five different judgements that all agreed with the fact that the clause was constitutionally invalid because it went against not only public policy but the Constitution. \r\nIt also impacted the rights of the children in so far as it compromised their basic right to education. \r", "citedCases": ["Governing Body of the Juma Musjid Primary School v Essay NO [2011] ZACC 13;

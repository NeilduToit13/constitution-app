The ban extended to any other piercings, including nose studs. A learner, taking part in a voluntary (non-compulsory) cultural and religious practice, pierced her nose and returned to school after the holidays wearing a nose stud, in contravention of the School Code of Conduct. Does the refusal of the school \u2013 in enforcing uniformity under the terms of its Code of Conduct, to which the learner consented through her parent upon admission to the school \u2013 amount to unfair discrimination and/or a violation of the learner\u2019s cultural and religious rights under sections 9 and 31 of the Constitution respectively? The Constitutional Court found that the refusal amounted to a violation of those rights; and that schools must reasonably accommodate differences and diversity in their communities. The Court found that it was legitimate (in general) for schools to promote uniformity in aiming to establish a disciplined school environment, but that exceptions (reasonable accommodations) must be allowed where demanded by the Constitution \u2013 as determined through a balancing of rights and interests. The Court ordered the School to amend its Code of Conduct to provide for exemption procedures allowing learners, on genuine cultural or religious grounds, to apply for permission to deviate from the uniform and other standards and requirements of the Code of Conduct, thereby allowing for the rights and interests to be weighed and balanced in the specific circumstances on a case-by-case basis.", "snippet": NaN, "facts": "Ms Sunali Pillay (the learner), through her mother Ms V Pillay (the Respondent), had consented to the school Code of Conduct upon admission to the school in 2002. The Code of Conduct banned the wearing of jewellery (at school), including any piercings, and except for plain stud earrings and wrist watches. A learner, taking part in a voluntary (non-compulsory) cultural and religious practice, pierced her nose and returned to school after the holidays wearing a nose stud, in contravention of the School Code of Conduct. After consultation between the parties, and between the School and experts, the School ultimately refused to allow her to continue wearing the nose stud and sought to enforce its Code of Conduct against her through conducting a disciplinary hearing. The refusal and scheduling of a disciplinary hearing prompted Ms V Pillay (the Respondent) to launch proceedings in the Equality Court.", "decision": "The Court noted that whilst uniforms and school rules serve an important purpose in education, the case was not about uniforms in general, but about a specific exemption to a uniform. The Court found that permitting this particular exemption would not endanger uniformity or school discipline in general; but rather that granting an exemption to Ms Sunali Pillay (the learner) might encourage more learners to express their religion or culture, which was to be celebrated, not feared (as diversity itself is to be promoted and celebrated not only tolerated). The Court ruled that the constitutional rights and protections (namely, under section 31) apply equally to both compulsory and voluntary (non-compulsory) practices of culture and religion.", "dissent": "O\u2019Regan J partially dissented. O\u2019Regan J agreed with most of the order and reasons of the majority, but disagreed with the part of the order in which the Court declared the refusal by the School to allow Ms Sunali Pillay to wear the nose stud as unfair discrimination (the declaratory relief).\n\nMs Sunali Pillay had graduated and left the school before judgment was handed down by the Constitutional Court. O\u2019Regan J argued that because of this, the declaratory relief was moot (\u2018pointless\u2019) and inappropriate. O\u2019Regan contended that had Ms Sunali Pillay still be enrolled at the School by the time the Court heard the case, it would have been appropriate to refer the matter back to the School for the proper exemption procedure to be carried out in accordance with its amended Code of Conduct.", "citedCases": ["Pillay v MEC for Education, KwaZulu-Natal, and Others 2006 (6) SA 363 (EqC); 2006 (10) BCLR 1237 (N)", "National Coalition for Gay and Lesbian Equality and Others v Minister for Home Affairs and Others 2000 (2) SA 1 (CC)", "JT Publishing (Pty) Ltd and Another v Minister of Safety and Security and Others 1997 (3) SA 514 (CC)", "Independent Electoral Commission v Langeberg Municipality 2001 (3) SA 925 (CC)", "AAA Investments Pty (Ltd) v Micro Finance Regulatory Council and Another 2007 (1) SA 343 (CC)", "Minister of Health and Another NO v New Clicks South Africa (Pty) Ltd (Treatment Action Campaign and Another as Amicus Curiae) 2006 (2) SA 311 (CC)", "South African National Defence Union v Minister of Defence and Others 2007 (5) SA 400 (CC)", "NAPTOSA and Others v Minister of Education Western, Western Cape Government and Others 2001 (2) SA 112 (C)", "Mandla and another v Dowell Lee and another 1983 (1) All ER 1062 (HL)", "Bernstein and Others v Bester and Others NNO 1996 (2) SA 751 (CC)", "Alexkor Ltd and Another v Richtersveld Community and Others 2004 (5) SA 460 (CC)", "Prince v President, Cape Law Society, and Others 2001 (2) SA 388 (CC) (Prince I)", "Prince v President, Cape Law Society, and Others 2002 (2) SA 794 (CC) (Prince II)", "Port Elizabeth Municipality v Various Occupiers 2005 (1) SA 217 (CC)", "Bhe and Others v Magistrate, Khayelitsha, and Others (Commission for Gender Equality as Amicus Curiae); Shibi v Sithole and Others; South African Human Rights Commission and Another v President of the Republic of South Africa and Another 2005 (1) SA 580 (CC)", "Affordable Medicines Trust and Others v Minister of Health and Others 2006 (3) SA 247 (CC)", "National Coalition for Gay and Lesbian Equality and Another v Minister of Justice and Others 1999 (1) SA 6 (CC)", "Christian Education South Africa v Minister of Education 2000 (4) SA 757 (CC)", "Harksen v Lane NO and Others 1998 (1) SA 300 (CC)", "Ferreira v Levin NO and Others and Vryenhoek and Others v Powell NO and Others 1996 (1) SA 984 (CC)", "Minister of Home Affairs and Another v Fourie and Another; Lesbian and Gay Equality Project and Others v Minister of Home Affairs and Others 2006 (1) SA 524 (CC)", "McLean v Sasol Mine (Pty) Ltd Secunda Collieries; McLean v Sasol Pension Fund 2003 (6) SA 254 (W) ", "Public Servants Association of South Africa and Others v Minister of Justice and Others 1997 (3) SA 925 (T)", "Eaton v Brant County Board of Education 1997 (1) SCR 241", "Central Okanagan School District No 23 v Renaud 1992 (2) SCR 970", "Multani v Commission Scolaire Marguerite-Bourgeoys 2006 (1) SCR 256", "R (on the application of Begum) v Head Teacher and Governors of Denbigh High School 2006 (2) All ER 487 (HL)", "Bato Star Fishing (Pty) Ltd v Minister of Environmental Affairs and Others 2004 (4) SA 490 (CC)", "Doctors for Life v Speaker of the National Assembly and Others 2006 (6) SA 416 (CC)", "Lyng, Secretary of Agriculture, et al v Northwest Indian Cemetery Protective Association et al 485 US 439 (1988)", "Pretoria City Council v Walker 1998 (2) SA 363 (CC)", "President of the Republic of South Africa and Another v Hugo 1997 (4) SA 1 (CC)", "Prinsloo v Van der Linde and Another 1997 (3) SA 1012 (CC)", "South African Broadcasting Corp Ltd v National Director of Public Prosecutions and Others 2007 (1) SA 523 (CC);"]}

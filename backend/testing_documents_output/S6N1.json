The 2016 Policy makes teaching primarily English: teaching is in both English and Afrikaans; and where demand is insufficient and recourses do not permit, only Afrikaans translations are provided, coupled with questions and answers in Afrikaans. \n\nThe Court upheld the 2016 Policy which was challenged under both section 29(2) and section 6 of the Constitution, ruling that it validly replaced the 2014 Policy which was not reasonably practicable as determined by the University.", "facts": "The Senate and Council of the University of Stellenbosch adopted a new language policy in 2016. The University\u2019s previous policy, adopted in 2014, established English and Afrikaans as languages of instruction (with interpretation). Compared to the 2016 Policy, the 2014 Policy would have cost an additional R640 million in infrastructure, plus about R78 million per year thereafter, entailing a 20% increase in fees (R8100 on top of the approximately R40 000 per year per student). The 2016 Policy makes teaching primarily English: teaching is in both English and Afrikaans \u2018where reasonably practicable and pedagogically sound\u2019 (parallel medium); and where demand is insufficient and recourses do not permit, only Afrikaans translations are provided, coupled with questions and answers in Afrikaans (as opposed to real-time interpreting). At the time of the judgment, Afrikaans was still offered on large scale at undergraduate level; all first-year lectures continue to be offered in Afrikaans; any student could be taught in English.", "decision": "The Court ruled, in respect of the section 6 challenge, that Afrikaans did not suffer \u2018historically diminished use and status\u2019 and therefore not qualify as a disadvantaged indigenous language in terms of section 6(2), even though it did qualify as indigenous; it only qualifies and is protected as an official language under section 6(4). \n\nThe state has a much wider margin under section 6(4) than under section 6(2). Under section 6(2), the state is obliged to advance historically diminished languages through \u2018practical and positive measures\u2019 without disregarding the official languages under section 6(4). However, under section 6(4), the state is only required to treat the official languages listed equitably by not diminishing them. This means that the state cannot disregard the official languages and is obliged to conserve them, but not at the expense of corrective, advancement measures under section 6(2).\n\nUltimately, the Court acknowledged that whilst the world was growing more hostile to minority languages, it was not the University\u2019s burden to prevent the decline of Afrikaans across South African tertiary institutions.[topic:T02];\nThe Court[topic:T03]", "dissent": "Moegoeng CJ concurred separately, emphasizing emphasized the need to develop all indigenous languages including the spoken languages of the First Nation people. \n\nFroneman J concurred separately, laying out the implications of English dominance as a medium of instruction, namely the diminished use and protection of minority indigenous languages.", "citedCases": ["Kanse v The President of the Convocation of the Stellenbosch University 2017 JDR 1687 (WCC)", "Plascon-Evans Paints Ltd v Van Riebeeck Paints (Pty) Ltd 1984 (3) SA 623 (A)", "Ex parte Gauteng Provincial Legislature: In re Dispute Concerning the Constitutionality of Certain Provisions of the Gauteng School Education Bill of 1995 1996 (3) SA 165 (CC)", "University of Free State v AfriForum 2017 (4) SA 283 (SCA)", "Head of Department Mpumalanga Department of Education and Another v Hoerskool Ermelo and Another 2010 (2) SA 415 (CC)", "AfriForum v University of the Free State 2018 (2) SA 185 (CC)", "AfriForum v Chairperson of the Council of the University of Pretoria 2017 JDR 0150 (GP)", "Bato Star Fishing (Pty) Ltd v Minister of Environmental Affairs and Tourism 2004 (4) SA 490 (CC)", "Minister of Environmental Affairs and Tourism v Phambili Fisheries (Pty) Ltd; Minister of Environmental Affairs and Tourism v Bato Star Fishing (Pty) Ltd 2003 (6) SA 407 (SCA)", "Logbro Properties CC v Bedderson N.O. 2003 (2) SA 460 (SCA)", "City of Johannesburg Metropolitan Municipality v Blue Moonlight Properties 39 (Pty) Ltd 2012 (2) SA 104 (CC)", "Turnbull-Jackson v Hibiscus Coast Municipality 2014 (6) SA 592 (CC)", "Tshwane City v AfriForum 2016 (6) SA 279 (CC)", "Daniels v Scribante 2017 (4) SA 341 (CC)"]}
